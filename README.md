# Tea-Set
"Paul Dunbar’s Tea Set"
Academic project to demonstrate Paul Dunbar’s (American Poet) Tea Set 3D model in VR with real working functions. The tea set consists of a filled teapot with tea, two cups,and Sugarcubes.

Functions: 
          Vapours comes from the hot tea.
          Sugarcube can be dropped in the cup of tea, which floats and dissolve slowly.
          Tea can be poured in the cup by lifting the teapot.
          
Blender3d is used to create the 3D models of the teapot, teacup, and plate. Unity3d engine is used to create the virtual environment.
A player is created to move in the virtualspace and controlled by mouse and arrow keys. Teapot can be raised, rotated, moved in all directions, also tea is poured into the cups.
This was my academic project performed within 3 members.
Enjoy a cup of tea!
