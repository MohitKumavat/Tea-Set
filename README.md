Vapours comes from the hot tea, sugarcube can be dropped in the cup of tea, which floats and dissolve slowly. Tea can be poured in the cup by lifting the teapot.

#Blender3d is used to create the 3D models of the teapot, teacup, and plate. #Unity3d engine is used to create the #virtual environment.

A player is created to move in the #virtualspace and controlled by mouse and arrow keys by writing a c# script. Teapot can be lifted, rotated, moved in all directions, also tea is poured into the cups.
